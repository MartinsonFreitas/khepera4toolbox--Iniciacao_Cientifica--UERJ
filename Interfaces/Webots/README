************************
* Makefile Explanation *
************************

WEBOTS_HOME and WK3_PORTABLE (library path) paths should be defined in
your ".bashrc" file.

Makefile at WK3_PORTABLE: compiles our library (libk3_webots.a).

Makefile at our Controller Path: does the make instruction for our
controller, including our libk3_webots.a library and needed headers at
WK3_PORTABLE. This makefile should be something like this:

	C_SOURCES=your_controller.c other_code.c

	# Your library
	MY_LIBRARY=-lk3_webots

	# Include Webots Makefile
	include $(WEBOTS_HOME)/projects/default/controllers/Makefile.include

	# Include headers and libraries paths
	INCLUDE= -I "$(WK3_PORTABLE)" -I"$(WEBOTS_HOME)/include"
	LIBRARIES= -L $(WK3_PORTABLE) $(MY_LIBRARY)


*****************************************************************
* What you can do with libk3_webots.a library and how to use it *
*****************************************************************

The code this library owns has been made trying to respect faithfully
khepera3toolbox' code style. So future improvement and modifications
can be made easily by anyone familiar with the toolbox.


For using this library you just need to add
	#include <khepera3.h>
in the source code of your Webots controller program.


Khepera3 module has been implemented, and it includes these submodules:
		
	KHEPERA3: defines the "sKhepera3" structure and initialization
	functions. It includes every Webots header needed for correct
	operation. A defined "control_step" variable is set to 32 ms by
	default in khepera3.h, present at every sudmodule needed
	(e.g. infrared and ultrasound).

	KHEPERA3_DRIVE: you can set motors speed and differential
	speed. Also get and set current position from encoders.

	KHEPERA3_MOTOR: defines the motor structure for later use in
	"khepera3_drive" submodule. No more things were implemented as
	they were useless. Main motor control is defined at
	"khepera3_drive".

	KHEPERA3_INFRARED: defines the "khepera3_infrared_proximity"
	function and creates a numerical index of each sensor. Does
	not define "khepera3_infrared_ambient".

	KHEPERA3_ULTRASOUND: defines everything previously defined in
	khepera3toolbox and initializes each sensor structure,
	setting only the first value of their fields. This task is
	implemented in "ultrasound_structure_init". Amplitude field
	is defined as 1 in "khepera3_ultrasound.h". These functions have
    not been tested.

The "odometry_track" module has been implemented:

The values of WHEEL_RADIUS 0.0212, AXLE_LENGTH 0.0893, and
ENCODER_RESOLUTION 440 have been added as #define to use the values
of the Webots model of the Khepera III.
